GitHub Pages
 
To publish this site with GitHub Pages (project site):

- Push this repository to GitHub.
- Enable Pages from the repository settings (branch: `main` or `gh-pages`, folder: `/root`).
- A `.nojekyll` file is included to ensure files with underscores or special names are served correctly.

All links and asset references use relative paths so the site works on a project Pages URL (https://<user>.github.io/<repo>/).
